        question: `How can I get the Premium plan for free?`,
        answer: 'Premium Alaan customers earn cashback rewards on every transaction made with their Alaan cardâ€”1% on domestic transactions (capped) and 1% on international transactions (unlimited). By spending at least AED 25,000 on international transactions or AED 50,000 on domestic transactions, you can effectively offset the cost of the Premium plan. In fact, many of our Premium customers not only get the platform for free but also earn enough cashback to offset various business expenses, turning Alaan into a profit-generating platform.',

    {
        question: 'How does the 1% cashback work?',
        answer: `No gimmicks, no hidden limits. With Alaan cards, earn unlimited 1% cashback on all international transactions (Premium and Enterprise plans). For instance, if your company spends AED 100,000 on eligible purchases, you earn a cashback of AED 2,000. As simple as that!`
